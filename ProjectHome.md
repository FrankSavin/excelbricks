ExcelBricks provides an easy way to automate common Excel tasks. Instead of writing VBA or recording macros you use high level commands entered in a Configuration sheet.


For instance, there is a single command to
  * get data from SQL Server and other Excel workbooks
  * add a formula to each row that is not blank
  * apply filters
  * refresh pivots
  * convert formulas to values, etc.


You can also use (and even write your own) external modules for more customized functionality. For example
  * split content from a column across multiple rows
  * merge rows by collating data from a column
  * extract words that match a pattern from a cell
  * extract data from text based files
  * generate a presentation from a workbook


ExcelBricks has undergone very many iterations. While this doesn't mean 0 bugs :-), it does ensure a pretty high standard for reliability, error-handling and performance to start off.
